# API Key Configuration Fix

## Problem
The app was working in the Android emulator (development mode) but API keys were not working in the production APK on real devices. This is a common issue with React Native/Expo apps where environment variables are handled differently between development and production builds.

## Root Cause
- In development mode, `process.env` is available and can access environment variables
- In production APK builds, `process.env` is not available at runtime
- The services were trying to access `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_*` which returned `undefined` in production

## Solution
Created a proper environment configuration system that works in both development and production:

### 1. Created `src/config/environment.ts`
- Uses Expo Constants to access environment variables in production
- Falls back to process.env for development
- Provides proper fallback values
- Includes debugging information

### 2. Updated `app.json`
- Added `extra` section with all environment variables
- This ensures variables are embedded in the production build

### 3. Updated All Services
- `conversationService.ts` - Now uses config for OpenAI API key
- `elevenLabsService.ts` - Now uses config for ElevenLabs API key
- `enhancedElevenLabsService.ts` - Now uses config for ElevenLabs API key
- `authService.ts` - Now uses config for Supabase credentials

## Files Changed
- `src/config/environment.ts` (new)
- `app.json` (added extra section)
- `src/services/conversationService.ts`
- `src/services/elevenLabsService.ts`
- `src/services/enhancedElevenLabsService.ts`
- `src/services/authService.ts`
- `build-stable-apk.sh` (added verification step)

## How It Works
1. **Development**: Uses `.env.local` file via process.env
2. **Production**: Uses app.json extra section via Expo Constants
3. **Fallback**: Uses hardcoded values if neither is available

## Testing
1. Build new APK with `./build-stable-apk.sh`
2. Install on real device
3. Check console logs for "Environment Configuration" to verify keys are loaded
4. Test API functionality (voice, chat, authentication)

## Security Note
In production, consider using Expo's secure store or a backend service to manage API keys instead of embedding them in the app bundle.
